/**
 * @fileoverview Booking Success Page
 * @description This static page confirms to the user that their booking and payment were successful.
 * 
 * @developer_notes
 * - **Navigation Trigger**: This page should only be reached after a successful payment callback from the payment gateway.
 * - **Data**: The booking ID is not present here for simplicity, but a real application might pass it in the URL
 *   to fetch and display a brief summary of the confirmed booking.
 * - **Backend Requirement**: Upon successful payment, the backend should:
 *   1. Update the booking status from 'Pending' to 'Confirmed'.
 *   2. Send a confirmation email to the user with all trip details.
 *   3. Create a notification for the trip organizer about the new booking.
